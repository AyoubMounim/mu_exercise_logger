# Mu-Gym Logger

This project is a simple logger to be used for gym activity book-keeping.
The logger is written in bash and has a simple and intuitive text user
interface.
Currently, all files needed for the logger run-time are stored in the following
directory: `$HOME/.local/share/mu_gym_logger/`.
We may change this in the future by adding configuration options.

## Usage

Just run the executable file `mu_gym_logger.sh` from anywere and follow the
interface indications.

## TODOs

Some changes and improvement that need to be addressed:

* Add configuration options.
* Add functions to visualize the logged data.
