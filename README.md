# Mu-Gym Logger

This project is a simple logger to be used for gym activity book-keeping. The
logger is written in bash and has a simple and intuitive text user interface.
By default, all files needed for the logger run-time are stored in the
following directory: `$HOME/.local/share/mu_gym_logger/`. This behavior can be
changed by setting the enviromental variable `MU_GYM_LOGGER_DIR` to any desired
directory.

## Usage

Just run the executable file `mu_gym_logger.sh` from anywere and follow the
interface indications.

## TODOs

Some changes and improvements that need to be addressed:

* Add functions to visualize the logged data.
* Add configuration options.
